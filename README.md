# ng2-parties
Example Angular2 application from ngAarhus meetup

The example shows of angular2 (alpha27). The PartyList-component shows a static list of Danish Parties from a service, and a seperate component in a seperate route (party-adder at /add) lets you add to the list. 

The adder also shows of the new `[(ng-model)]`-syntax.

To play with this example load it from a server. If you change anything, remember to run the typescript compiler.
