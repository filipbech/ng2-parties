# ng2-parties
Example Angular2 application from ngAarhus meetup

The example shows of angular2 (alpha26). The PartyList-component shows a static list of Danish Parties from a service, and a seperate component (party-adder) lets you add to the list. 

The adder was meant to show off the form-controls, however these no longer works in alpha26. I hope Im able to keep this repository updated with coming versions, and show of the most relevant features. 

To play with this example load it from a server. If you change anything, remember to run the typescript compiler.

**Please star this repository if you want me to keep up to date - if no start I can spend my time better**
